# Pitonisa: Diceware Divination.

Is it possible to use Diceware passphrases as a divination method?

Many divination methods are randomisers at their core. On top they add some set of symbols to convey knowledge.

Diceware is a method to generate secure and easy to remember passphrases using 6 sided dice and a very long list of 7.776 words.

This experiment aims to produce a shared log of diceware words cast as oracles.
